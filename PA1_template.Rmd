# Instructions

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

#Data:
The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

Dataset: Activity monitoring data [52K]
The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as 𝙽𝙰)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.

#Assignment

##Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
#Load the data
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = T)
#view the data
str(data)
head(data)
summary(data)

#Process/transform the data 
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
data$interval <- factor(data$interval)

```

##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

    1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
    
```{r}
#remove na data
data2 <- na.omit(data)
head(data2)

#get total steps per day

total_steps <- aggregate(steps~date, data= data2, sum)

total_steps

```

    2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}

hist(total_steps$steps, main = "histogram of the total number of steps taken each day", breaks = 50, xlab = "Number of Steps", col = "blue")


```
    
    3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
    
```{r}

mean_steps <- mean(total_steps$steps)
median_steps <- median(total_steps$steps)

mean_steps
median_steps

```

The mean steps is 10766.19
The median steps is 10765

    
## What is the average daily activity pattern?


    1. Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}

#calculat the average steps 

average_steps <- aggregate(steps~interval, data= data2, mean)

#plot the data

plot(y = average_steps$steps, x = as.integer(average_steps$interval), type="l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average Number Of Steps", main = "Average Step vs. Interval", col = "blue" )

```

    2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
    
```{r}

max(average_steps$steps)

average_steps[average_steps$steps == (max(average_steps$steps)),]$interval

```

The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps (206.1698 steps ) is the interval 835.

## Imputing missing values

    1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
    
```{r}

nrow(data) - nrow(data2)

```

There are 2304 missing values in the dataset.


    2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}

# use the mean of the 5-minute interval to fill the missing value
na_rows <- subset(data, is.na(data$steps))

fill_fun <- function(x){
 v= average_steps[average_steps$interval == x,]$steps
 return(v)
}

na_rows$steps <- unlist(lapply(na_rows$interval, fill_fun))


```



    3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}

final <- rbind(na_rows, data2)
str(final)
head(final)
summary(final)

```

    4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
    
```{r}

#calculate total steps
total_final <- aggregate(steps~date, data= final, sum)

#calculate the mean and median
mean_final <- mean(total_final$steps)
median_final <- median(total_final$steps)

mean_final
median_final

#plot 
hist(total_final$steps, main = "histogram of the total number of steps taken each day", breaks = 50, xlab = "Number of Steps", col = "blue")

```

The new mean steps is 10766.19 and the new median steps is 10766.19. Mean steps are the same but median steps are different from the old one. Imputing missing data may change median. 

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

    1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
    
```{r}

days <- weekdays(final$date)
weekday <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday" , "Thursday", "Friday")
weekend <- c("Saturday", "Sunday")
days[days %in% weekday] <- "weekday"
days[days %in% weekend] <- "weekend"
table(days)
final$days <- factor(days)

head(final)

```


    2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
    
```{r}

library(lattice)

#calculate average steps
average_final_weekday <- aggregate(steps~ interval, data= final[final$days == "weekday",], mean )

average_final_weekday$day <- "weekday"

average_final_weekend <- aggregate(steps~ interval, data= final[final$days == "weekend",], mean )

average_final_weekend$day <- "weekend"

average_final <- rbind(average_final_weekend, average_final_weekday)

xyplot(steps~ interval | day, data = average_final, layout = c(1,2), type = "l", ylab = "Number of Steps")


```

The plot shows that that activity on the weekends is higher than activity on the weekdays.
